# Poor Man's Rekognition - Project Tracker   
CCExtractor Development project under Google Summer of Code 2019  

## Overview
A free and Open Source alternative to Amazon Rekognition.
[View proposal](https://github.com/sziraqui/pmr-gsoc-tracker/blob/master/Proposal-PMR-CCExtractor.pdf)   

The project is divided into 3 parts-    

**1. Nodoface** (Phase 1 : Jun 3 - Jun 24)  
Nodejs bindings for [Tadas OpenFace](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace) to bring all face detection and facialattribute prediction features into PMR   

**2. PMR-Core** (Phase 2 : Jun 28 - July 22)    
Will include    
- TensorflowJS implementation of [ArcFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface).
- Integration of Nodoface and ArcFace TFJS model into a high levelAPI in TypeScript.   
- Real-time video annotation using object tracking and PMR-Corefor local execution.    

**3. PMR-web**  (Phase 3: July 26 - August 19)    
A REST API for PMR-Core following Amazon Rekognition API design.
